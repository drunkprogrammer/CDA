Set£¨c++£©

Sets are containers that store unique elements following a specific order.

In a set, the value of an element also identifies it (the value is itself the key, of type T), and each value must be unique. The value of the elements in a set cannot be modified once in the container (the elements are always const), but they can be inserted or removed from the container.

Internally, the elements in a set are always sorted following a specific strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its internal comparison object (of type Compare).

set containers are generally slower than unordered_set containers to access individual elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order.

Sets are typically implemented as binary search trees.
